```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading the data

The dataset we will be using is a bivaraite dataset with a phenotype (numeric)
with 107 samples. The goal is to access whether or not there is dependency between
the two variables after the phenotype has been accounted for. This dataset
was subsetted from the BrainSpan (microarray) dataset, so we do not have 
access to whether or not they are dependent in truth.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
