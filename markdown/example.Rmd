## Loading the data

The dataset we will be using is a bivaraite dataset with a phenotype (numeric)
with 107 samples. The goal is to access whether or not there is dependency between
the two variables after the phenotype has been accounted for. This dataset
was subsetted from the BrainSpan (microarray) dataset, so we do not have 
access to whether or not they are dependent in truth.

```{r cars}
library(statCognition)
dat <- statCognition::dat
```

For purely illustrative purposes, let's plot the data so we know what it
looks like. Typically (in an actual usage), we would discourage the user
from looking at the data in any way prior to completing the system. We code the
phenotype \texttt{Days} so large values are red and small values are blue.

```{r}
compute_color <- function(x){
  sapply(1:nrow(x$pheno), function(y){
    rgb(min(max((x$pheno[y,1])/107,0),1), 0, min(max((107-x$pheno[y,1])/107,0), 1))
  })
}

plot(dat$mat[,1:2], xlab = "", ylab = "", pch = 16, yaxt = "n", xaxt = "n", asp = T,
     col = compute_color(dat))
```

## Setting up the system

Let us decide what the stages of our analysis will be as well as the actions
and state functions for each stage. We will consider 3 stages: the first
stage to remove phenotype effects, the second stage to remove outliers, 
and the third stage to estimate whether or not there is dependency.

```{r}
action_ll <- vector("list", 3)
action_ll[[1]] <- list(RC_none = RC_none, RC_linear_regression = RC_linear_regression,
                       RC_pairing_difference = RC_pairing_difference)
action_ll[[2]] <- list(SS_none = SS_none, SS_cook = SS_cook, 
                       SS_neighborhood = SS_neighborhood)
action_ll[[3]] <- list(PD_pearson = PD_pearson, PD_kendall = PD_kendall,
                       PD_energy = PD_energy)
names(action_ll) <- c("Remove_confounder", "Sample_selection", "Pairwise_dependency")
```

```{r}
state_ll <- vector("list", 3)
state_ll[[1]] <- list(state_pheno_MI = state_pheno_MI, 
                      state_pheno_residual = state_pheno_residual)
state_ll[[2]] <- list(state_variance = state_variance, 
                      state_interpoint = state_interpoint)
state_ll[[3]] <- list(state_samples = state_samples, state_linearity = state_linearity)
names(state_ll) <- c("Phenotype", "Outlier", "Dependency")
```

## Creating synthetic data

For the system to learn our preferences on how to analyze data, we'll need
to generate synthetic data. Let's generate 20 synthetic datasets and 
plot them all. Each synthetic dataset is labeled by a seed, so the cognition
system can reconstruct exactly the same synthetic datasets without you explicitly
needing to store them.

```{r}
syn_init <- synthetic_initializer(lambda = 4)
syn_list <- vector("list", 20)
seed_vec <- rep(0, 20)

par(mfrow = c(4,5), mar = rep(0.1, 4))
for(i in 1:20){
  set.seed(i)
  res <- synthetic_generator(dat, syn_init)
  plot(res$mat[,1:2], xlab = "", ylab = "", pch = 16, yaxt = "n", xaxt = "n", asp = T,
       col = compute_color(res))
  
  syn_list[[i]] <- res
  seed_vec[i] <- get_seed(res)
}

seed_vec
```

## Recording the pipelines

After some investigation, we record the results
```{r}
response_vec <- c(1,2,1,   2,1,3,  1,1,1,   2,1,3,  1,1,1,
                  1,3,3,   2,1,1,  1,1,1,   3,2,1,  1,2,1,
                  1,1,3,   1,1,1,  3,1,1,   1,1,1,  3,2,1,
                  1,1,1,   1,3,3,  2,3,3,   3,1,1,  1,1,3)
```

Now we feed them into the statistical cognition system.
```{r, cache=T}
cog_init <- stat_cognition_initializer(action_ll = action_ll, 
                                                       state_ll = state_ll,
                                                       generator_init = syn_init)

res_cog <- stat_cognition(dat, cog_init, seed_vec, response_vec, store = T)
```

Now we can evaluate the value functions.
```{r}
result <- evaluate(res_cog, dat)
result
```

We see that our pipeline returns that there is a dependency between the two
variables. Here is how the learned pipelined analyzed the data.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))

plot(dat$mat[,1:2], xlab = "", ylab = "", pch = 16, yaxt = "n", xaxt = "n", asp = T,
     col = compute_color(dat), main = "Original data")
dat2 <- action_ll[[1]][[result$pipeline[1]]](dat)
plot(dat2$mat[,1:2], xlab = "", ylab = "", pch = 16, yaxt = "n", xaxt = "n", asp = T,
     main = "Remove Phenotype")
dat2 <- action_ll[[2]][[result$pipeline[2]]](dat2)
plot(dat2$mat[,1:2], xlab = "", ylab = "", pch = 16, yaxt = "n", xaxt = "n", asp = T,
     main = "Remove Outlier")
```

## Interpreting the value function

We can plot the contribution functions. We start with the last one.

```{r}
plot(res_cog$value_list[[3]], samples = T, contribution = T, ylab = "Value", pch = 16)
```

```{r}
plot(res_cog$value_list[[2]], samples = T, contribution = T, ylab = "Value", pch = 16)
```

```{r}
plot(res_cog$value_list[[1]], samples = T, contribution = T, ylab = "Value", pch = 16)
```
